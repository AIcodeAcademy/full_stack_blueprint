# Project structure

## Folders

- Prefer organization by feature than technology

```txt
dist/
docs/ 
src/
tests/
```

## File naming

- Export only one artifact per file
- Use the following naming convention `{{business}}.{{technical}}.ts`, where :
  - business is related to functional or specification domain
  - technical is one of: `type` | `component` | `util` ...


# Type Script rules

- Prefer `type` over `interface`
- Prefer functions over classes
- Prefer `#` over `_` for private members
- Avoid `null` and `undefined`
- Avoid deep nested anonymous functions by asigning named functions
- Avoid deep nested control structures by using early returns
- Validate data using plain TS functions no ValueObjects needed
- Avoid external libraries as much as possible
