# Testing

## Use Playwright for e2e testing

- Create one spec file for each feature at `/tests/{{feature number}}_{{feature name}}.spec.ts`
- Use **GWT** pattern for describing the tests.
- Use **AAA** pattern for organizing test code.
- Name variables following this convention: 
  - `inputX` for input data
  - `mockX` for mock functions or classes
  - `actualX` for actual results
  - `expectedX` for expected results

## HTML CSS Selectors

- Read the current `src/components` implementation
- Prefer selection by role and content (like a user would do)
- Add any `id`, `role` or `name` attribute to source code to simplify test selections.
