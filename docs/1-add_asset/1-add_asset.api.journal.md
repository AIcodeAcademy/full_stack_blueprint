# API Implementation Journal for Add Asset Feature

## Key Decisions

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Used existing auth utils to get user from request
   - All asset endpoints require authentication
   - Categories endpoint is public for easier asset creation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive validation for asset creation
   - Used domain-level validation to ensure data integrity
   - Included date format validation for acquisition_date

3. **Response Transformation**
   - Created separate response types for clean API contracts
   - Used transformation functions to map domain to response types
   - Kept user_id internal, not exposed in responses

4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Used SQL utils for data access
   - Kept business logic in controllers
   - Added proper typing for all database operations
