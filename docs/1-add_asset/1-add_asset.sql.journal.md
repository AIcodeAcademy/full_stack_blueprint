# SQL Implementation Journal for Feature 1 - Add Asset

## Implementation Summary

Implemented the SQL layer for the Add Asset feature, including:

1. SQL Commands:
   - Created `categories.sql.json` with CRUD operations and seed data
   - Created `assets.sql.json` with CRUD operations and user-specific queries
   - Reused existing `users.sql.json` for user relationships

2. Domain Types:
   - Created `category.type.ts` with validation for risk and liquidity levels
   - Created `asset.type.ts` with validation for value, quantity and acquisition date
   - Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces

3. Database Initialization:
   - Updated `initialize.utils.ts` to handle new tables
   - Added seeding for categories with predefined asset types

## Key Decisions

1. Schema Design:
   - Used INTEGER for IDs with AUTOINCREMENT
   - Used DECIMAL(10,2) for asset values to handle precise monetary amounts
   - Added FOREIGN KEY constraints for data integrity
   - Made category names UNIQUE to prevent duplicates

2. Validation Rules:
   - Asset value and quantity must be positive numbers
   - Acquisition date cannot be in the future
   - Categories must have predefined risk and liquidity levels (Low/Medium/High)

3. Security:
   - Added userId checks in asset operations for data isolation
   - Joined queries to provide category names while maintaining data access control
