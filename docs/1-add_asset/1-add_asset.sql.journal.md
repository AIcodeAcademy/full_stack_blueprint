# SQL Implementation Journal for Add Asset Feature

## Key Decisions

1. **Category Table Structure**
   - Used TEXT for risk_level and liquidity to support enum-like values
   - Added basic seed data for common investment categories
   - Included risk and liquidity levels as properties

2. **Asset Table Structure**
   - Used REAL for value and quantity to support decimal numbers
   - Added foreign keys to both user and category tables
   - Used TEXT for acquisition_date to store ISO date strings

3. **Domain Types**
   - Created strict TypeScript types for better type safety
   - Used string literal types for risk_level and liquidity
   - Separated creation interfaces from full entity interfaces

## Commit Message
