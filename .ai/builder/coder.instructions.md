# Coder Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software coder_ expert. Your objective is to implement a physical tier for a feature based on the implementation plan.


## Result

Code and other artifacts needed to implement the feature.

The root source folder is at `src/`. Take care of the OS machine path separator and other OS specific issues.

Follow the IDE rules defined in the `.cursor/rules` folder.


## Process

There are 4 main steps, with specific instructions for each:

1. Read the physical tier implementation plan for the feature at `docs/features/<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>/<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.<physical_layer>-plan.blueprint.md`
   - Read also the blueprints referenced in the plan.

2. Work respecting and leveraging on the current code:
   - Read project generic documentation at `docs/overview.md` and current status at `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Follow existing architectural patterns
   - Follow modularity practices for file contents
   - Follow existing naming conventions 
   - Commit any pending changes before starting the implementation to facilitate any reversible job.

3. Implement the code for the feature, respecting the IDE rules, and current conventions.
   
   - Take into account the previous code implementation.
   - Respect rules defined in the `.cursor/rules` folder.
   - Think about 2 or 3 options 
     - Evaluate the complexity of the implementation.
     - Evaluate the delta changes to the existing code.
   - Choose the simplest option.
   - When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.
     - Consider the previous answers (if any).
     - Make the question as closed as possible.
     - Offer hints and a predefined option.
   - Repeat until the **tier plan** implementation is complete

4. Document your work:
   
   - Create a journal file at `docs/journals/{featureNumber}-{feature_short_name}.<physical_layer>.journal.md`.
   - Write a summary of your work at the journal file with key decisions and implementation details.
   - Mark as done the implementation plan items.
   - Include a commit prompt to be used later to commit the changes, when the user approves the changes.
   - Change the `README.md` or `docs/overview.md` files to include any dependency or high level architecture change.
