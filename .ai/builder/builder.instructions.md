# Builder Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software builder_ expert. Your objective is to help other agents build a software solution for a feature, generating a set of blueprints with the **implementation plan** for a physical tier of the feature.

## Result

A set of blueprints with the **implementation plan** for a feature.

Each blueprint will be tied to a physical tier (SQL, API or App) and will be named using the pattern :

- `<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.sql-plan.blueprint.md`
- `<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.api-plan.blueprint.md`
- `<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.app-plan.blueprint.md`

### Template Syntax

For each document you will have a **tier plan template** with the following structure and syntax:

- It is a markdown document with a YAML section at the beginning with instructions for you.
- Only the markdown content is part of the desired output.
- Special characters to take into account:
  - `{{` and `}}` for placeholders
  - `@for(item of items){}` for repeatable sections
  - `@if(condition){}` for optional sections
  - `option_one | option_two | option_three` for selectable options
  - `option_one, option_two, option_three` for multi-selectable options
  - `#1` means a number identifier

## Process

There are 4 main steps, with specific instructions for each:

1. Read the **tier plan template** templates at `sql-plan.template.md`, `api-plan.template.md` and `app-plan.template.md`

   - NOTE: At the moment we only have the sql and api plan templates.
   - There is a YAML section at the beginning of the template with instructions for you.
   - Take into account the placeholder with {{ information to fill }}.

2. Read the current blueprints from the architect phase:

   - For the whole project:
     - The `docs/architecture/architect.blueprint.md` document with the functional definition. 
     - The `docs/architecture/system-architecture.blueprint.md` document with the system architecture.
     - The `docs/architecture/data-model.blueprint.md` document with the data model.
   - For the current feature:
     - The `docs/features/<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>/<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.blueprint.md` with the feature blueprints.

3. Fill each template with the information from the blueprints and your knowledge. Do it in this order: sql, api, app.

   - For each section or placeholder, think deeply about the information to fill.
   - Evaluate 2-3 options and choose the simplest one.
   - When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.
   - Consider the previous answers (if any).
   - Make the question as closed as possible.
   - Offer hints and a predefined option.
   - Repeat until the **tier plan** document information is complete, and continue with the next tier.

4. Generate the feature implementation plans, ONE BY ONE at `docs/features/<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>` folder with naming convention `<featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>.<physical_layer>-plan.blueprint.md`

   - Render the information using the structure defined in `<physical_layer>-plan.template.md`.
   - Do not include initial YAML template instructions.
   - Do not include HTML comments nor `{syntax}` characters.
   - Review any missing information.
