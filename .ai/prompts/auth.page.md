Follow @client-page.mdc rules to create the page, the presenter component and the resource for an `auth` route. 
Do not create different components for login and register. Try to use the same code for both.
Create also the types needed at `src/client/domain`
Add the page to the navigation, in the @navigation.utils.ts file
Add a link in the header nav at @header.component.ts
